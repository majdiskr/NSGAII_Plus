# NSGA-II+ for Vehicular Fog Computing

This repository contains MATLAB implementation of the NSGA-II+ algorithm with:
- Adaptive population sizing
- Dynamic convergence
- Pareto-based selection
- Custom mutation/crossover

## How to Run

1. Load your input data (task workload, deadlines, etc.)
2. Execute `MainNSGA.m` or `NSGA2_2.m`
3. Results will include delay, energy, convergence time

## Requirements

- MATLAB R2021a+
- Parallel Computing Toolbox (optional)
